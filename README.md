# 👋 Hi, I’m Rachel Sady

I’m an aspiring **SOC Analyst / Incident Support Analyst** with a background in **healthcare, regulated environments, and customer-facing incident communication**. I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on **identity compromise, phishing response, incident documentation, and SOC operations**.

My experience in healthcare taught me how to remain calm during high-pressure situations, protect sensitive data, and clearly communicate risk and next steps to non-technical stakeholders—skills I now apply to cybersecurity incident response.
